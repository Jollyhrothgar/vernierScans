dlist -f -t 14 /common/a7/eventdata/EVENTDATA_ppg_P00-0000434156-0000.PRDFF

-f tells dlist to list from a file, -t tells dlist to look for event type '14' which happens to be the scalar type
We were looking at the substructure of the event, stored as packets, specifically packet 900, which contains the
actual scalaer counts for physics scalers (i.e. the counts from the triggers on the trigger readout - 0-32


dpipe -sf -dn -i /common/a7/eventdata/EVENTDATA_ppg_P00-0000434156-0000.PRDFF
dpipe will take infomation from a pRDF and pipe it to either another prdf or to the console. -sf means "source = file",
-dn means "destination nothing". -i means show information.

dpipe -sf -dn -i /common/a7/eventdata/EVENTDATA_ppg_P00-0000434156-0000.PRDFF | grep -i "scaler event"
Example to search output from dpipe for just scaler events.

dpipe -sf -dn -i -n50 /common/a7/eventdata/EVENTDATA_ppg_P00-0000434156-0000.PRDFF
example to show just the first 50 events.


This area was generated using a perlscript: writePmonProdject.pl

We added (for the environment) a "-m32" to the CXX flags area of the makefile.
We then softlinked the makefile to the standard name (this option exists to
prevent overwriting Makefiles in an area with many packet monitors). To
generate the area, we did: ":~> writePmonProject.pl clock".
